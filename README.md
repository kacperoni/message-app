## What I've learned

Improved my **_OOP_** skills in **_PHP_**. There is still much to learn but I think I'm on the right way. I'm more confident with **_Javascript_** and **_AJAX_** techniques. Decided to not use **_jQuery_** until I'm not be able to do it with **_Vanilla_** **_JS_**. Some **_MySQL_** basics about datetime and formating these values in **_PHP_**. **_Docker_** essentials like for example, creating container with **_MariaDB_** and Adminer.

## TODO

- Validation
- Auto scroll to bottom on loading chatbox.
- Deploy application on heroku or other hosting.
- Add some small preview of last message with specific user in list of all conversations.
- Add dates of the sent messages.
